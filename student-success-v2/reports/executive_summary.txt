3. KEY FINDINGS
----------------------------------------
  1. Moderate prediction of first-year struggle is possible (ROC AUC: 0.665), but additional features may improve accuracy.
  2. Math track placement significantly impacts academic performance. Students on different tracks show statistically different outcomes.
  3. College Algebra students CAN succeed in Computer Science (Success rate: 63.8%), though additional support is recommended.
  4. First semester/year GPA is a strong predictor of overall academic success. Early intervention during Year 1 is critical.
  5. Academic misconduct risk can be partially predicted from admission data (ROC AUC: 0.523). Proactive integrity education is recommended.

      Conclusion: College Algebra students CAN succeed in CS

6. RECOMMENDATIONS
----------------------------------------
  1. EARLY WARNING SYSTEM: Deploy the first-year struggle prediction model to identify at-risk students during admission. Flag students with >50% risk probability for immediate academic support enrollment.
  2. MATH SUPPORT PROGRAM: Create differentiated support programs for each math track. College Algebra students pursuing quantitative majors (CS, Engineering, MIS) should receive supplementary math tutoring and extended office hours.
  3. FIRST SEMESTER INTERVENTION: Implement mandatory check-ins for all students after week 6 of first semester. Students with GPA < 2.5 should be enrolled in academic success workshops and peer tutoring programs.
  4. ACADEMIC INTEGRITY PROGRAM: Conduct proactive academic integrity workshops during orientation. Students identified as higher risk should receive additional ethics training and citation skills workshops.
  5. GRADUATION TIMELINE ADVISING: Students predicted to need >8 semesters should receive enhanced academic advising including optimized course sequencing, summer course recommendations, and workload management support.
  6. MAJOR-SPECIFIC MENTORING: Pair at-risk students with successful upper-year students in their intended major. Focus on majors with higher struggle rates.
  7. ANALYTICS DASHBOARD: Deploy the interactive dashboard for admissions officers and academic advisors to access real-time risk predictions and student insights.

7. IMPLEMENTATION PRIORITIES
----------------------------------------
HIGH PRIORITY:
  • Deploy early warning system for incoming students
  • Implement first-semester intervention protocols
  • Create math track support programs
